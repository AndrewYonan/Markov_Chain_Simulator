Markov Chain Simulator (Finite State Machine)
Group members (1) : Andrew Yonan

A Markov chain is a stochastic process wherein the next state of a system depends only on the current state. The following program simulates a general finite-state Markov chain based on varying transition matrices, input by the user. The program (eventually) can output various metrics and mathematical properties of the given Markov chain, such as communication classes, recurrent classes, transient classes, and (possibly) periodicity, and irreducibility. 

Program usage:
$make //compile
$make run //run
$make clean //remove .class files
